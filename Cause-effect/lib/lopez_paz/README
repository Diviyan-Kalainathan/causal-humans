to extract features of all the pairs, run:
  python train.py 0 <number_of_random_features_to_extract>
the features are stored in pickles/features_train.pkl and pickles/weights_train.pkl

train and test the classifier on a 50/50 train/test partition:
  python train.py 1 <number_trees> <features_per_tree_split> <tree_depth>
the classifier is stored in pickles/classifier.pkl

the test AUC is printed last. The previous winner achieves 0.82.

QUICK EXAMPLE:

dlopez@c72:~$ python train.py 0 100
dlopez@c72:~$ python train.py 1 100 10 5
built tree 1 of 100, train score = 1.091052e+00
built tree 2 of 100, train score = 1.062847e+00
...
100 10 5 0.868 0.589 # AUC is 0.589
